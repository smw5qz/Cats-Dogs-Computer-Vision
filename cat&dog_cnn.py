"""Now it is your turn! Set each of the variables below correctly. (They should no longer equal `None`.)

Create image generators for each of the three image data sets (train, validation, test). Use `ImageDataGenerator` to read / decode the images and convert them into floating point tensors. Use the `rescale` argument (and no other arguments for now) to rescale the tensors from values between 0 and 255 to values between 0 and 1.

For the `*_data_gen` variables, use the `flow_from_directory` method. Pass in the batch size, directory, target size (`(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH)`), class mode, and anything else required. `test_data_gen` will be the trickiest one. For `test_data_gen`, make sure to pass in `shuffle=False` to the `flow_from_directory` method. This will make sure the final predictions stay is in the order that our test expects. For `test_data_gen` it will also be helpful to observe the directory structure.


After you run the code, the output should look like this:
```
Found 2000 images belonging to 2 classes.
Found 1000 images belonging to 2 classes.
Found 50 images belonging to 1 classes.
